    abstract = {Background Monitoring the reasons why a considerable number of people do not receive recommended vaccinations allows identification of important trends over time, and designing and evaluating strategies to address vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake. Existing validated measures assessing vaccine hesitancy focus primarily on confidence in vaccines and the system that delivers them. However, empirical and theoretical work has stated that complacency (not perceiving diseases as high risk), constraints (structural and psychological barriers), calculation (engagement in extensive information searching), and aspects pertaining to collective responsibility (willingness to protect others) also play a role in explaining vaccination behavior. The objective was therefore to develop a validated measure of these 5C psychological antecedents of vaccination.   Methods and findings Three cross-sectional studies were conducted. Study 1 uses factor analysis to develop an initial scale and assesses the sub-scales’ convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity (N = 1,445, two German convenience-samples). In Study 2, a sample representative regarding age and gender for the German population (N = 1,003) completed the measure for vaccination in general and for specific vaccinations to assess the potential need for a vaccine-specific wording of items. Study 3 compared the novel scale’s performance with six existing measures of vaccine hesitancy (N = 350, US convenience-sample). As an outcome, a long (15-item) and short (5-item) 5C scale were developed as reliable and valid indicators of confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility. The 5C sub-scales correlated with relevant psychological concepts, such as attitude (confidence), perceived personal health status and invulnerability (complacency), self-control (constraints), preference for deliberation (calculation), and communal orientation (collective responsibility), among others. The new scale provided similar results when formulated in a general vs. vaccine-specific way (Study 2). In a comparison of seven measures the 5C scale was constantly among the scales that explained the highest amounts of variance in analyses predicting single vaccinations (between 20% and 40%; Study 3). The present studies are limited to the concurrent validity of the scales.   Conclusions The 5C scale provides a novel tool to monitor psychological antecedents of vaccination and facilitates diagnosis, intervention design and evaluation. Its short version is suitable for field settings and regular global monitoring of relevant antecedents of vaccination.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, regression models were created to explain the increase of COVID-19 vaccination rates in 378 Polish sub-regions. In order to trace the factors that could explain the willingness to delay vaccination, vaccination rates were compared for age groups of 20 years and more for 30 June 2020 and 31 January 2021. Initially high vaccination rates, rather than leading to the gradual exhaustion of the pool of those wishing to get vaccinated, were a very good predictor of the share of the remainder willing to do so, which increased the divergence between sub-regions in nominal vaccination rates. Support for Eurosceptic and anti-establishment parties was a strong predictor of persistent vaccine hesitancy. Ideological divergence from the mainstream appeared to reinforce vaccine hesitancy, and this relationship remained highly relevant even when controlling for possible time or spatial lag. Markers of social inclusion and social capital—voter turnout and employment rate—remained statistically significant even when controlling for time lag, thus implying clear relevance of trust in the public message. The share of the population with higher education remained a highly relevant factor as well, though in the 20–39 age bracket it predicted a higher vaccination rate, while in all older brackets it was a negative predictor—this implies that those people had already made up their minds. Delaying vaccination seems predominantly explainable by political views, as well as social exclusion and the historical specificity of sub-regions. On a regional level, there was actually a paradoxical Spearmans Rho correlation (0.641) between the share of population refusing mandatory vaccination for kids and the percentage of people receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, which further undermines the idea that overall observed vaccine hesitancy was in any meaningful way affected by anti-vaccine movements.},

abstract = {Vaccine hesitancy is a serious threat to global health; however, significant COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy exists throughout the United States. The 5C model, which postulates five person–level determinants for vaccine hesitancy – confidence, complacency, constraints, risk calculation, and collective responsibility – provides one theoretical way of understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The present study examined the effects of these 5C drivers of vaccine behavior on early vaccine adoption and vaccine intentions above and beyond theoretically salient demographic characteristics and compared these associations across a National sample (n = 1634) and a statewide sample from South Carolina (n = 784) – a state with documented low levels of COVID-19 vaccination uptake. This study used quantitative and qualitative data collected in October 2020 to January 2021 from the MFour-Mobile Research Panel, a large, representative non-probability sample of adult smartphone users. Overall, the South Carolina sample reported lower COVID-19 vaccine intentions and higher levels of 5C barriers to vaccine uptake compared to the National sample. Findings further indicated that both demographic characteristics (race) and certain drivers of vaccine behavior (confidence and collective responsibility) are associated with vaccine trust and intentions across samples above and beyond other variables. Qualitative data indicated that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was driven by fears about the quick vaccine development, limited research, and potential side effects. Although there are some limitations to the cross-sectional survey data, the present study offers valuable insight into factors associated with early COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy across the United States.}

ABSTRACT = {Due to the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines, the world has faced a huge challenge with their general acceptance, including Poland. For this reason, we attempted to determine the sociodemographic factors influencing the decision of positive or negative attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination. The analysis included 200,000 Polish participants—80,831 women (40.4%) and 119,169 men (59.6%). The results revealed that the most common reasons for vaccine refusal and hesitancy were the fear of post-vaccination complications and their safety (11,913/31,338, 38.0%; 9966/31,338, 31.8%). Negative attitudes were observed more often among male respondents with primary or secondary education (OR = 2.01, CI95% [1.86–2.17] and OR = 1.52, CI95% [1.41–1.63], respectively). On the other hand, older age ≥ 65 (OR = 3.69; 95%CI [3.44–3.96]), higher education level (OR = 2.14; 95%CI [2.07–2.22]), living in big cities with a range of 200,000–499,999 inhabitants and more than 500,000 inhabitants (OR = 1.57, CI95% [1.50–1.64] and OR = 1.90, CI95% [1.83–1.98], respectively), good physical conditions (OR = 2.05; CI95% [1.82–2.31]), and at last normal mental health conditions (OR = 1.67, CI95% [1.51–1.85]) were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Our study indicates which population group should be further supplied with data and information by health education, the government, and healthcare professionals to alleviate the negative attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines.},

In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},
